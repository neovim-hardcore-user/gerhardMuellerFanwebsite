[Verse 1]
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I am found
Was blind, but now I see

[Verse 2]
′Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

[Verse 3]
Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come
'Twas grace has brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home

[Verse 4]
When we′ve been there ten thousand years
Bright, shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we′ve first begun

[Verse 5]
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I am found
Was blind, but now I see
